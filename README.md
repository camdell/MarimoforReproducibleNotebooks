# Using Marimo for Reproducible Notebooks

## Description

Have you ever opened a Jupyter notebook and realized that the outputs don’t
match the code? Hidden state, out-of-order execution, and long notebooks can
make reproducing results challenging.

In this free webinar, we’ll introduce **Marimo**, a reactive notebook
environment designed to eliminate these issues. You’ll see how it ensures your
results always match your code, keeps notebooks clean and versionable, and
supports interactive elements like sliders and dropdowns.
